The animations .rar contains all of Mario's animations in the game. Some of the animations have scaling errors that you'll have to correct for them to work properly, but they should work wonderfully otherwise. Beware though, the animations folder is 130MB uncompressed so make sure you are willing to use that much space before unRARing it. In addition, they will only work if you use the bones from the original .max file. Importing the .dae will NOT allow you to use the animations.
